## funcs.cpp

- line 29: like the use of fill_n with the back_inserter() iterator; know it's pretty simple, but didn't know that was a thing and it's nice and concise

## makefile

- okay wow this is huge and intimidating but it makes a very nice and neat result so I can say that's good

## indent.cpp and unindent.cpp

- line 10: okay seriously what c++
- very tiny complaint: indent uses the redent function, unindent uses the dedent function, would be slightly more clear if they shared naming conventions, I think?
